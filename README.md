# Code Practice and Experiments

---

This repository is for my personal practicing of algorithms and datastructures and experimentation of various libraries and languages. There really won't be any planned structure to this repository due to the fact that it's going to be pretty full of randomly unconnected sub-projects/problems/experiments in a variety of languages. The primary languages of this repository will be **Python**, **C++**, and **C**. Most of the compilable code will be target for Linux platforms, but some of it will be Windows experiments. Many of the Code Practice problems will be from the fantastic book __Cracking The Coding Interview__ and sites like __Leet Code__. The format of the solutions to my practice problems will either by in Jupyter Notebooks or C++ files, with unit testing frameworks: Python's UnitTest and Google's gtest. I may setup some of the C++ projects with proper CMake files.

Moving on... Below is about as organized of a layout of everything as you'll get.

## Code Practice

The sub-categories of Code Practice are basically just solving interview challenge type problems.

---

### Cracking the Coding Interview

* Chapter One Problems and Solutions

### Leet Code
* Add Two Linked Lists in C++
* LRU Cache in C++

## Experiments

The sub-categories of Experiments range from toying with various Computer Science concepts to implementing algorithms and datastructures from scratch using low level languages. Other topics may include: Network Programming, Embedded Systems, Computer Vision, Data Analysis, Robotics.

### Algorithms and Datastructures:
* Singly Linked List in C
* Queue/Stack in C
* Modern C++ Singly Linked List
